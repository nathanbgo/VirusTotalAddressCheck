# VirusTotalAddressCheck
This script reads alerts sent to a mailbox and performs a VirusTotal lookup to see if it is associated with any malicious activity. If malicious activity is detected, the IP address is added to a file that a firewall can use for a blocklist. An email is sent out with results.
